# Description:
#    Based on content in "Report on modelling work done for BREAD 101218v2_print.pdf"
#    Nitrogen is assumed to be held in 6 pools in the soil:
#            mineral N (nitrate and ammonium) and organic N (DPM, RPM, BIO and HUM-N)
#    loss by each process is adjusted using a loss adjustment ratio to account for
#    the losses by the other processes so that all processes are assumed to occur simultaneously
#    there is a critical minimum level of minimum N, below which, the mineral N cannot fall
#    The nitrate and ammonium pools are initialised at the minimum level, and the model run for 10 years
#    to establish the amount of nitrate or ammonium at the start of the forward run.
#    NO2 = nitrite; NO3 = nitrate; NH4 = ammonium; N2O = nitrous oxide; NO = nitric oxide
